You can use the open function to create a file object that can
 read and write files. It takes two arguments, the path of the file
 and the mode (mode optionally defaults to reading). You use
 the mode to indicate, among other things, if you want to read or
 write a file and if it is text or binary data. You can open a text
 file using the mode r to read its contents. The file object has a
 read method that returns the contents of the file as a string:

In [1]: file_path = 'bookofdreams.txt'

In [2]: open_file = open(file_path, 'r')

In [3]: text = open_file.read() In [4]: len(text) Out[4]: 476909

In [5]: text[56] Out[5]: 's'

In [6]: open_file

Out[6]: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='bookofdreams.txt'

mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>

In [7]: open_file.close()
